# Analyzing Student Admission Data to Graduate implement by Keras

Put neural networks into practice! 

In the notebook below, we'll analyze a dataset of student admissions at UCLA. 

Implement some of the steps in the training of the neural network:

- One-hot encoding the data
- Scaling the data
- Writing the backpropagation step
