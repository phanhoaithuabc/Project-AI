# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN

Implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. 
>Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. 

Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.
