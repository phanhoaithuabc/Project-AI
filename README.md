### Table Of Contents

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* <b> Introduction to Neural Networks:</b> Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* <b> Sentiment Analysis with NumPy:</b> [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* <b> Introduction to PyTorch:</b> Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* <b> Convolutional Neural Networks:</b> Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* <b> Transfer Learning:</b> In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
* <b> Weight Initialization:</b> Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* <b> Autoencoders:</b> Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.
* <b> Style Transfer:</b> Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks:</b> by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!

### Recurrent Neural Networks

* <b> Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN):</b> Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.
* <b> Embeddings (Word2Vec):</b> Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* <b> Sentiment Analysis RNN:</b> Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.
* <b> Attention:</b> Implement attention and apply it to annotation vectors.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

* <b> Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST:</b> Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.
* <b> Batch Normalization:</b> Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.
* <b> Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN):</b> Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* <b> CycleGAN:</b> Implement a CycleGAN that is designed to learn from unpaired and unlabeled data; use trained generators to transform images from summer to winter and vice versa.
